# sb-encoder
An encoder that translates your words into s and b and a decoder that does the opposite.

This is just for the funnies (sb means 傻逼, which means dumb fuck in Mandarin) and is not intended to be secure in any way. Do not abuse this.

~~Also, there are still some residue bugs. I will fix those when I feel like it.~~ The bug with input of 'n' is fixed.

# To use
Just download and click on the .exe file. Both upper and lower case letters are ok, so is whitespace. Nothing else is permitted. **DO not type numbers, it will break.** 

~~Whitespace bugs cin and readline out, so I'm not planning on dealing with that soon.
I'm new with C++, leave me alone.~~ I added whitespace. I might add more numbers in later, that seems easy enough anyways.

If you have any suggestions, fork and pull I guess.
